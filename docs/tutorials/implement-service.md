# Implement a service

This tutorial shows how to implement a [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) in the CSIA-PME project step by step.
It will guide you through the process of creating a [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) with or without a model.

!!! Info
    Note that a [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) can be implemented in any programming language as long as it follows the [specifications](/csia-pme/reference/service/#specifications) of the CSIA-PME project. This tutorial is using Python 3.10.

## Tutorial

### Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need to have the following tools installed:

- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- An IDE (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### 1. Service without a model

#### 1.1 Get the source code

First, you can download or clone the source code from the [CSIA-PME service templates repository](https://github.com/csia-pme/services-templates).

In this tutorial, we will implement a [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) that does not require a model, so we will use the `sample-service-without-model` template.

Open your terminal and copy the content of the template to a new folder called `image-rotate`. Then go inside it.

```bash
cp -r sample-service-without-model image-rotate
cd image-rotate
```

#### 1.2 Create a virtual environment

Instead of installing the dependencies globally, it is recommended to create a virtual environment.

To create a virtual environment, run the following command inside the project folder:

```sh
python3.10 -m venv .venv
```

Then, activate the virtual environment:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 1.3 Install the dependencies

For the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) to work we will need to install numpy and opencv-python in addition to the dependencies of the template.
So edit the `requirements.txt` file and add the following lines:

```txt hl_lines="2 3"
common-code[test] @ git+https://github.com/csia-pme/csia-pme.git@main#subdirectory=common-code
numpy==1.24.1
opencv-python==4.7.0.72
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the default [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) dependencies and the ones we just added.

#### 1.4 Implement the service

##### 1.4.1 Update the README

Open the `README.md` file and update the title and the description of the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service).

```md
# Image Rotate

This service rotates an image by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
```

##### 1.4.2 Update the service kubernetes configuration

In the `kubernetes` folder, you will find the configuration files for the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service).

Rename all the files by replacing `sample-service` with `image-rotate`.

``` sh
image-rotate
├── kubernetes
│   ├── image-rotate.config-map.yaml
│   ├── image-rotate.ingress.yaml
│   ├── image-rotate.service.yaml
│   └── image-rotate.stateful.yaml
└── ...
```

Open the `image-rotate.config-map.yaml` file and update `sample-service` with `image-rotate`.

```yaml hl_lines="5 8 15"
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  # TODO: 1. CHANGE THE NAME OF THE CONFIG MAP (1)!
  name: image-rotate-config
  labels:
    # TODO: 2. CHANGE THE APP LABEL (2)!
    app: image-rotate
data:
  ENVIRONMENT: development
  LOG_LEVEL: debug
  ENGINE_URLS: '["http://engine-service:8080"]'
  # TODO: 3. CHANGE THE SERVICE URL (3)!
  # (the port must be the same as in the sample-service.service.yml and unused by other services)
  SERVICE_URL: http://image-rotate-service:8001
```

1. Change the name of the config map to `image-rotate-config`
2. Change the app label to `image-rotate`
3. Change the service url to `http://image-rotate-service:8001`. The port must be the same as in the `image-rotate.service.yaml` and unused by other services. (this is for local development only)

Open the `image-rotate.ingress.yaml` file and update `sample-service` with `image-rotate`.

```yaml hl_lines="5 12 20 26"
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  # TODO: 1. CHANGE THE NAME OF THE INGRESS (1)!
  name: image-rotate-ingress

            # TODO: 3. CHANGE THE NAME OF THE SERVICE (3)!
            name: image-rotate-service
            port:
              number: 80
  tls:
    - hosts:
        # TODO: 4. CHANGE THE HOST (4)!
        - image-rotate-csia-pme.kube.isc.heia-fr.ch
```

1. Change the name of the ingress to `image-rotate-ingress`
2. Change the host to `image-rotate-csia-pme.kube.isc.heia-fr.ch`
3. Change the name of the service to `image-rotate-service`
4. Change the host to `image-rotate-csia-pme.kube.isc.heia-fr.ch`

!!! info "Note"
    The host can be changed to your own domain name if the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) is deployed on another Kubernetes cluster.

Open the `image-rotate.service.yaml` file and update `sample-service` with `image-rotate`.

```yaml hl_lines="5 11 16"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  # TODO: 1. CHANGE THE NAME OF THE SERVICE (1)!
  name: image-rotate-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - name: http
      # TODO: 2. CHANGE THE PORT (must be the same as in the sample-service.config-map.yml) (2)!
      port: 8001
      targetPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    # TODO: 3. CHANGE THE APP LABEL (3)!
    app: image-rotate
```

1. Change the name of the service to `image-rotate-service`
2. Change the port to `8001`. The port must be the same as in the `image-rotate.config-map.yaml` and unused by other services. (this is for local development only)
3. Change the app label to `image-rotate`

Open the `image-rotate.stateful.yaml` file and update `sample-service` with `image-rotate`.

```yaml hl_lines="6 9 12 17 22 26 28 44"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  # This name uniquely identifies the stateful set
  # TODO: 1. CHANGE THE NAME OF THE STATEFUL SET (1)!

        image: ghcr.io/csia-pme/csia-pme-sample-service:latest
        # If you build the image locally, change the next line to `imagePullPolicy: Never` - there is no need to pull the image
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: MAX_TASKS
          value: "50"
        - name: ENGINE_ANNOUNCE_RETRIES
          value: "5"
        - name: ENGINE_ANNOUNCE_RETRY_DELAY
          value: "3"
        envFrom:
          - configMapRef:
              # TODO: 8. CHANGE THE NAME OF THE CONFIG MAP (8)!
              name: sample-service-config
```

1. Change the name of the stateful set to `image-rotate-stateful`
2. Change the app label to `image-rotate`
3. Change the name of the service to `image-rotate`
4. Change the app label to `image-rotate`
5. Change the app label to `image-rotate`
6. Change the name of the container to `image-rotate`
7. Change the image name to `ghcr.io/csia-pme/csia-pme-image-rotate-service:latest`
8. Change the name of the config map to `image-rotate-config`

!!! warning "TODOs"
    When you are done, you need to remove all the TODOs from the files.

##### 1.4.3 Update the service code

First open the `.env` file and update the `SERVICE_URL` variable to `http://localhost:8001`. The port must be the same as in the `image-rotate.config-map.yaml` file.

```bash hl_lines="12"
# Log level
LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=development

# The Engine URL
ENGINE_URLS=["http://localhost:8080"]

# The Service URL
# TODO: 1. REPLACE THE PORT WITH THE SAME AS IN THE CONFIG-MAP FILE (1)!
SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8001"

# The maximum of tasks the service can process
MAX_TASKS=50

# The number of times the service tries to announce itself to the Engine
ENGINE_ANNOUNCE_RETRIES=5

# The number of seconds between each retry
ENGINE_ANNOUNCE_RETRY_DELAY=3
```

1. Replace the port with the same as in the `image-rotate.config-map.yaml` file.

All the code of the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) is in the `main.py` file.
The [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) is a simple image rotation service that rotates the image by 90, 180, 270 degrees clockwise depending on the value of the `rotation` parameter.

Open the `main.py` with your favorite editor and follow the instructions below.

1. Import the OpenCV library and the get_extension function from the tasks service. This function is used to guess the extension of the image based on the input type.
2. Change the description of the service.
3. Change the name and the slug of the service. This is used to identify the service in the engine.
4. Change the input/output fields of the service. The name of the field is the key of the dictionary that will be used in the process function. The type of the field is the type of the data that will be sent to the service. They are defined in the FieldDescriptionType enum.
5. Change the process function. This is the core of the service. The data is a dictionary with the keys being the field names set in the data_in_fields. The result must be a dictionary with the keys being the field names set in the data_out_fields.
6. Change the API description and summary.
7. Change the API title, version, contact and license.

##### 1.4.4 Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image of the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service). We need to add some packages in order to use the OpenCV library.

```dockerfile hl_lines="6"
# Base image
FROM python:3.10

# Install all required packages to run the model
# TODO: 1. Add any additional packages required to run your model (1)!
RUN apt update && apt install --yes ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6
...
```

1. Add ffmpeg, libsm6 and libxext6 to the list of packages to install.

#### 1.5 Create the Workflow for GitHub Actions

First, if you don't have the file already, download the `sample-service-without-model.yml` file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/csia-pme/services-templates/workflows) and rename it to `image-rotate.yml` in the `.github/workflows` folder.

Open it with your IDE and modify the `sample-service` texts with `image-rotate`

!!! info "Note"
    The host can be changed to your own domain name if the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) is deployed on another Kubernetes cluster.

#### 1.6 Test the service

Now that the service is ready, we can test it.

Open a terminal, navigate to the `image-rotate/src` and run the following command:

```bash
pytest --cov-report term:skip-covered --cov-report term-missing --cov=. -s --cov-config=.coveragerc
```

All the tests should pass.

```bash
======================== test session starts =========================

```

In order to test the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service), you need to have a running engine. To do so, follow the instructions in the [Engine](/csia-pme/reference/engine/#start-the-service-locally-with-minikube-and-the-docker-image-hosted-on-github) reference.

Once the engine is running, you can start the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) by running the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host localhost --port 8001 # (1)!
```

1. The port must be the same as the one defined in the `.env` file and different from the one used by the engine.

The output should be similar to the following:

```

Now, you can test the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) by sending a request to the engine. To do so, open your browser and navigate to the following URL: `http://localhost:8080/`. You should see the following page:

![image-rotate](../assets/screenshots/image-rotate.png)

Now you can test the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) by uploading an image and selecting the rotation. Create a file called rotation.txt and add the following content:

```txt
90
```

Now, you can unfold the `/image-rotate` endpoint and click on the Try it out button. Now upload the image and the rotation file and click on the Execute button. The response body should be something similar to the following:

```json hl_lines="12"
{
  "created_at": "2023-03-01T10:59:41",
  "updated_at": null,
  "data_in": [

      {
        "name": "image",
        "type": [

          "image/jpeg"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "rotation",
        "type": [
          "text/plain"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "data_out_fields": [
      {
        "name": "result",

        ]
      }
    ],

    "url": "http://localhost:9393",
    "summary": "\nRotate an image by 90 degrees clockwise.\n"
  },
  "pipeline": null
}
```

Now, copy the id of the task and unfold the GET `/tasks/{task_id}` endpoint under the Tasks name.

1. Click on Try it out and paste the id in the task_id field.
2. Click on Execute.
3. In the body response, find the `data_out` field and copy the id of the image (e.g. `a38ef233-ac01-431d-adc8-cb6269cdeb71.png`).
4. Now, unfold the GET `/storage/{key}` endpoint under the Storage name.
5. Click on Try it out and paste the id of the image in the key field.
6. Click on Execute.
7. Click on the Download file button and save the image in your computer.

The image should be rotated by 90 degrees.

!!! success "Congratulations!"
    You have successfully created a [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) and tested it locally. Now, you can push the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) to GitHub and deploy it on the engine using the workflow created in the previous section.

### 2. Service with a model

In this section, you will create a service that uses a model.

#### 2.1 Get the source code

First, you can download or clone the source code from the [CSIA-PME service templates repository](https://github.com/csia-pme/services-templates).

In this tutorial, we will implement a [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) that does require a model, so we will use the `sample-service-with-model` template.

Open your terminal and copy the content of the template to a new folder called `ano-detection`. Then go inside it.

```bash
cp -r sample-service-without-model ano-detection
cd detection
```

#### 2.2 Create a virtual environment

Instead of installing the dependencies globally, it is recommended to create a virtual environment.

To create a virtual environment, run the following command inside the project folder:

```sh
python3.10 -m venv .venv
```

Then, activate the virtual environment:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 2.3 Install the dependencies

For the service to work we will need to install some dependencies of the template.
So edit the `requirements.txt` file and add the following lines:

```txt hl_lines="2 3"
common-code[test] @ git+https://github.com/csia-pme/csia-pme.git@main#subdirectory=common-code
matplotlib==3.6.3
numpy==1.24.2
pandas==1.5.3
scikit-learn==1.2.1
tensorflow==2.9.0
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the default [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) dependencies and the ones we just added.

#### 2.4 Implement the service

##### 2.4.1 Update the README

Open the `README.md` file and update the title and the description of the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service).

```md
# Anomaly detection

This service detects anomalies in a time series.
```

##### 2.4.2 Update the service kubernetes configuration

In the `kubernetes` folder, you will find the configuration files for the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service).

Rename all the files by replacing `sample-service` with `ano-detection`.

``` sh
ano-detection
├── kubernetes
│   ├── ano-detection.config-map.yaml
│   ├── ano-detection.ingress.yaml
│   ├── ano-detection.service.yaml
│   └── ano-detection.stateful.yaml
└── ...
```

Open the `ano-detection.config-map.yaml` file and update `sample-service` with `ano-detection`.

```yaml hl_lines="5 8 15"
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  # TODO: 1. CHANGE THE NAME OF THE CONFIG MAP (1)!
  name: ano-detection-config
  labels:
    # TODO: 2. CHANGE THE APP LABEL (2)!
    app: ano-detection
data:
  ENVIRONMENT: development
  LOG_LEVEL: debug
  ENGINE_URLS: '["http://engine-service:8080"]'
  # TODO: 3. CHANGE THE SERVICE URL (3)!
  # (the port must be the same as in the sample-service.service.yml and unused by other services)
  SERVICE_URL: http://ano-detection-service:8001
```

1. Change the name of the config map to `ano-detection-config`
2. Change the app label to `ano-detection`
3. Change the service url to `http://ano-detection-service:8001`. The port must be the same as in the `ano-detection.service.yaml` and unused by other services. (this is for local development only)

Open the `ano-detection.ingress.yaml` file and update `sample-service` with `ano-detection`.

```yaml hl_lines="5 12 20 26"
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  # TODO: 1. CHANGE THE NAME OF THE INGRESS (1)!

  tls:
    - hosts:
        # TODO: 4. CHANGE THE HOST (4)!
        - ano-detection-csia-pme.kube.isc.heia-fr.ch
```

1. Change the name of the ingress to `ano-detection-ingress`
2. Change the host to `ano-detection-csia-pme.kube.isc.heia-fr.ch`
3. Change the name of the service to `ano-detection-service`
4. Change the host to `ano-detection-csia-pme.kube.isc.heia-fr.ch`

!!! info "Note"
    The host can be changed to your own domain name if the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) is deployed on another Kubernetes cluster.

Open the `ano-detection.service.yaml` file and update `sample-service` with `ano-detection`.

```yaml hl_lines="5 11 16"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  # TODO: 1. CHANGE THE NAME OF THE SERVICE (1)!
  name: ano-detection-service

      targetPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    # TODO: 3. CHANGE THE APP LABEL (3)!
    app: ano-detection
```

1. Change the name of the service to `ano-detection-service`
2. Change the port to `8001`. The port must be the same as in the `ano-detection.config-map.yaml` and unused by other services. (this is for local development only)
3. Change the app label to `ano-detection`

Open the `ano-detection.stateful.yaml` file and update `sample-service` with `ano-detection`.

```yaml hl_lines="6 9 12 17 22 26 28 44"
apiVersion: apps/v1

              # TODO: 8. CHANGE THE NAME OF THE CONFIG MAP (8)!
              name: sample-service-config
```

1. Change the name of the stateful set to `ano-detection-stateful`
2. Change the app label to `ano-detection`
3. Change the name of the service to `ano-detection`
4. Change the app label to `ano-detection`

7. Change the image name to `ghcr.io/csia-pme/csia-pme-ano-detection-service:latest`
8. Change the name of the config map to `ano-detection-config`

!!! warning "TODOs"
    When you are done, you need to remove all the TODOs from the files.

##### 2.4.3 Update the service code

First open the `.env` file and update the `SERVICE_URL` variable to `http://localhost:8001`. The port must be the same as in the `ano-detection.config-map.yaml` file.

```bash hl_lines="12"
# Log level
LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=development

# The Engine URL
ENGINE_URLS=["http://localhost:8080"]

# The Service URL
# TODO: 1. REPLACE THE PORT WITH THE SAME AS IN THE CONFIG-MAP FILE (1)!
SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8001"

# The maximum of tasks the service can process
MAX_TASKS=50

# The number of times the service tries to announce itself to the Engine
ENGINE_ANNOUNCE_RETRIES=5

# The number of seconds between each retry
ENGINE_ANNOUNCE_RETRY_DELAY=3
```

1. Replace the port with the same as in the `ano-detection.config-map.yaml` file.

All the code of the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service) is in the `main.py` file.

Open the `main.py` with your favorite editor and follow the instructions below.

1. Import the library.
2. Change the description of the service.
3. Change the name and the slug of the service. This is used to identify the service in the engine.
4. Change the input/output fields of the service. The name of the field is the key of the dictionary that will be used in the process function. The type of the field is the type of the data that will be sent to the service. They are defined in the FieldDescriptionType enum.
5. Change the process function. This is the core of the service. The data is a dictionary with the keys being the field names set in the data_in_fields. The result must be a dictionary with the keys being the field names set in the data_out_fields.
6. Change the API description and summary.
7. Change the API title, version, contact and license.

##### 2.4.4 Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image of the [Service](/csia-pme/reference/service). We need to copy the model in the docker.

```dockerfile hl_lines="3"
# Copy model
# TODO: 1. Change the name of the model file to match the name of your model file
COPY ae_model.h5 .
```

1. Change the name of the model file to match the name of your model file.

#### 2.5 Create the Workflow for GitHub Actions

First, if you don't have the file already, download the `sample-service-without-model.yml` file from the [GitHub repository](/csia-pme/services-templates/workflows) and rename it to `ano-detection.yml` in the `.github/workflows` folder.

Open it with your IDE and modify the `sample-service` texts with `ano-detection`
